# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks|<b4/>.

```{r}
cleaned_cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4/>") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients))

cleaned_cocktail_data <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\b((\\d+\\d+\\s*/\\s*\\d+)|(\\d+\\s*/\\s*\\d+)|(\\d+\\s*\\.\\s*\\d+)|(\\d+))\\s*(oz|bsp|dashes|dash|ml|cl|tsp|tbsp)?\\s*\\b")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\(\\s*%\\s*abv\\s*\\)")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients))

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
sorted_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  select(ingredients) %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(str_to_upper(ingredients))
  
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
count(sorted_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

top_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

max_count <- top_ingredients$n[10]

top_ingredients <- top_ingredients %>%
  filter(n >= max_count)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

top_coctails <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n == max(n))

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
rare_ingredient <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(n) %>%
  filter(n==min(n))

count_ingredient <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(n)

count(rare_ingredient) 

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

cockatils_with_rare_ingredient <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredient$ingredients)  %>%
  select(name) %>%
  distinct(name)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

cockatils_without_rare_ingredient <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  filter(!name %in% cockatils_with_rare_ingredient$name)  %>%
  select(name) %>%
  distinct(name)
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

cocktail_ingredient_table <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  select(name, ingredients) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredients,
    values_from = ingredients,
    values_fn = function(x) ifelse(length(x) > 0, "X", ""),
    values_fill = ""
  )


```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
